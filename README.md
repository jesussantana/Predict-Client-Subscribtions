![Predict Client Subscribtions](https://esmarketingdigital.com/images/subscriptions.png)


## Create a predictive algorithm (Machine Learning or Deep Learning) to predict the correct time to buy cardano and the correct time to sell.   



---

## ‚ú® BACKGROUND ‚ú®
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. 

---  

## ‚ú® DATASET ‚ú®
Datasets are available here Input variables bank client data:

- 1 - age (numeric)
- 2 - job : type of job (categorical: "admin.","unknown","unemployed","management","housemaid","entrepreneur","student", "blue-collar","self-employed","retired","technician","services")
- 3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "married","divorced","single"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
- 4 - education (categorical: "unknown","secondary","primary","tertiary")
- 5 - default: has credit in default? (binary: "yes","no")
- 6 - balance: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric)
- 7 - housing: has housing loan? (binary: "yes","no")
- 8 - loan: has personal loan? (binary: "yes","no")
### Related with the last contact of the current campaign:

- 9 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: "unknown","telephone","cellular")
- 10 - day: last contact day of the month (numeric)
- 11 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")
-12 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)
### Other attributes:

- 13 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
- 14 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)
- 15 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
- 16 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success")
### Output variable (desired target):

- 17 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no") 

---

## ‚ú®üèÜ TASK üèÜ‚ú®
Create a predictive algorithm (Machine Learning, NOT ANN) to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).

---

## ‚ú® DELIVERY ‚ú®
Paste the link to your Github repository with two files, one containing all the code you have made in either '.py' or '.ipynb' format. And another file with the values predicted by your algorithm, the values that are 0,1 or 2. The file with the predictions has to be a '.csv' and only has to be a column with the predictions as it appears in the example file 'example_predictions_delivery.csv'.
